ToDo
* ~Setup IDE~
* Import common libraries to elastic as stix2 literals (att&ck, galaxies, etc) - treated as a direct creator identity object (commit 1)
* Ingest sample data feeds as literal stix2 (indcator feed, aptgo, other open source) - treated as an indirect interprative identity object (commit 1)
* Create interpolation layer to enhance feeds (ie: literal incoming --> data model) through _only adding_ stix entities (ie: no de-dupe, no deletion, no editing unless up-versioning because you can't because you aren't the creator) - treated as a direct creation from new identity object (commit 2)
* Create facility for adding further commits from other direct creation identity objects (commits x)
* Establish use cases for 'end goal' data 'molecules'
* Establish methods for moving from one to the other.
